"use strict";//use strict mode is avoid excuses like not defining variable using var/let
let firstName = "harshit";//firstName = "harshit";
console.log(firstName);
let second = 344;//second = 344;
second = second+34//let second = second+34; v cannot redlare variablename twice using let unlike var
console.log(second);
